Read by larry wilson. The ice queen by ernest angers. Thrown upon their own resources. The early dusk of a december day. What's fast changing into darkness has three of the young people with whose adventures this story is concerned. Trudge to briskly home. The day was a bright. And alec the oldest. Who was a skilled workmen in the brass foundry. Although scarcely 18 years of age. Had given himself a half holiday. In order to take kate and the youngster on a long skating expedition down to the lighthouse. Kate was his sister 2 years younger than he. At the youngster was a brother who's 12th birthday this was. The little fellow never had had so much fun and one afternoon he thought. And maintain steadily that he scarcely felt tired at all. The ice has been in splendid condition. The day calm but cloud. So that their eyes had not. Have they had been able to go far out upon the solidly frozen surface. Of the. How far do you think we have skated today al. Ask the youngster. Its 4 miles from the lower bridge to the lighthouse. Spook up k. Before alex could reply. Add four back. That makes 8 me to begin with. Yes it said al. And on top of that you must put. Let me. I should think counting all our twists and turns. Fully 10 me more. We were almost the best of stony point when we were farthest out. And they say that's a 5 mi long. All together then we skated about 18 mi. Write my boy your arithmetic is your strong point. Well. I should say his feet were his strong point today. Casey explained in admiration of her brother's hardihood. It wasn't a bad day's work for a girl i know of either remarked alec has he took the key from his pocket and opened the door of their house. Which was soon bright with lamp. Add a crackling fire of oak and hickory. The house these three dwelt in was a small cottage in an obscure street of the village. But it was warm and tight. Kate west housekeeper and the youngster whose real name was james. Contractor first into gym and then into jim kim. What's man of all. Add me to call work to sometimes when kate needed his help. While these two are getting tea and alec is carefully wiping the skates and putting them away where no rust can have a chance at the blades. Or mice not the strap. Let me tell you a few things about the family. Jim could remember his father only vaguely. Play kate and alex could tell us all about him. His name was kincaid. And he was a master builder of houses. He had bought and fitted up the cottage. And i put savings in the. The mrs kincaid was sick much of the time. So that money was spent that would have been laid by for a rainy day. If she had been strong and well. Unfortunately the rain came sooner than anyone thought for. One day about 5 years before the beginning of our little story. Papa was brought home hurt by falling from a scaffold at the top of the house. He was not dead. And i thought he would be well again in a few weeks at most. But instead he grew slowly. And after a time died. Then the poor mother always we. Did the best she could. I keep trying to help her while alex stopped his school going. I went to work in the brass foundry. At first though he could earn but a little. Add mr kincaid's saving slowly melted away. Until almost nothing was left. Then the tired and doesn't mother never strong bet your children that long farewell that seems so terribly hopeless to all of us. When we are young. Who are the three little bears were thrown upon their own resources. The question arose as to what they should do. Jim was now 8 years old and going to school. Kate has not neglected to do some studying. And a great deal of reading too. Though she had always been so busy. And a few weeks before her mother's death. She had begun to study regularly with a lady who lived near. Open katy repaid by picky various small fruit. As the matured in the ladies large garden. Alec as i have said. Was working steadily and getting enough wages to keep them all in fair comfort. Since they own the house in the left garden to give them plenty of vegetables. So after talking the prospect over. Did you decided to stay in the little house and live together. A letter was written to uncle andrew in cleveland. Who had offered kate and jimmy a home. Telling him they would try it alone a while before burning any of their friends. This decision had been made almost 4 years before my story open. And it had not been regretted. They had even saved somebody. Put the larger part of this has been spent in repairing the house. And then fitting up a new boat for jim and one of his friends. Who thought they knew a way to make a little money in the summer vacation if they had a good boat. This boat had been completed only in time to prove how good it was. Before the winter had closed the river with ice at an unusually early date. Another pretty crap was safely stored in a warehouse at the schooner landing a mile below the town. All slept very sadly after their skating holiday. Even rex the great newfoundland dog. Who was the member of the family by no means to be over. But their ears were not stopped so tight that the klinger of the church bells about midnight. Failed to arouse him with his dreadful alarm of fire. Listening to an upper window one glance at the blaze red in heaven. Showed our friends that the group of factories in the southern part of the town. Was byrne. And one of these was the brass foundry where alec worked. I like hurried away and they did not see him until after sunrise. When he came home tired. And set blacken.
